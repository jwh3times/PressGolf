# Let's go

Picks up where `/handoff` left off on the other machine. The handoff doc lives in Proton Drive and
`handoff_map.json` beside it names the active doc per repo.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the lets-go skill to resume this repo's handoff."

The map is read and written only through `../handoff/scripts/handoff-map.mjs`, relative to this skill's
directory — run it from the repo root so it can name the repo from the `origin` remote.

## How the Handoffs folder reaches this machine

Two transports, decided by what is installed:

- **Desktop client** (Windows) — the Proton Drive client keeps
  `~/Proton Drive/<account>/My files/Documents/Handoffs` in sync on its own. Writing into that folder
  is the whole sync; the CLI steps below are skipped.
- **CLI mirror** (Fedora, where no client exists) — `proton-drive` (the Proton Drive CLI) is on
  `PATH` and `HANDOFFS_DIR` names a local mirror folder. Nothing syncs by itself: each **Pull** and
  **Push** block below is run explicitly, and the cloud folder is always
  `/my-files/Documents/Handoffs`. A CLI reply of `You need to login first` means the user must run
  `proton-drive auth login` first; that is an interactive step, not one for the agent.

Decide once at the start: `command -v proton-drive` succeeds **and** the desktop client's folder is
absent means CLI mirror; otherwise desktop client.

## Steps

### 1. Look up the handoff

**Pull** (CLI mirror only) — fetch the current map before reading it:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HANDOFFS_DIR"
proton-drive filesystem download -f remove /my-files/Documents/Handoffs/handoff_map.json "$HANDOFFS_DIR"
```

```
node <skills directory>/handoff/scripts/handoff-map.mjs get
```

- `file` is `null` → report "No active handoff for `<key>`." and stop.
- `exists` is `false`, CLI mirror → the doc is fetched by name, then `get` is rerun:

  ```bash
  proton-drive filesystem download -f remove "/my-files/Documents/Handoffs/<file>" "$HANDOFFS_DIR"
  ```

  A `Node not found` reply means the other machine has not pushed the doc to the cloud yet. Report
  the file name, leave the map untouched, and stop, so a retry after sync still works.

- `exists` is `false`, desktop client → Proton Drive has not synced the doc to this machine yet.
  Report the expected path, leave the map untouched, and stop.

Otherwise read the whole doc at `path`.

### 2. Sync the workspace to it

Update both trees (the public checkout and, when present, `private/`):

```
git fetch origin --prune
git status --short --branch
git -C private fetch origin --prune
git -C private status --short --branch
```

Bring the checkout to the state the doc's **State** section describes: fast-forward `main`, or check
out the branch it names from `origin`. A dirty tree, a diverged branch, or a branch missing from
`origin` (work left local only on the other machine) → stop and ask how to proceed.

Then check the doc's claims against live state: issues since closed, PRs since merged, next steps
already done. The doc is a snapshot and `end-session` ran after it was written, so note every
discrepancy; live state wins.

### 3. Mark it consumed

```
node <skills directory>/handoff/scripts/handoff-map.mjs clear --expect <file>
```

This sets the repo's entry to `null`. It refuses when the map now names a different file — a newer
handoff arrived meanwhile — so stop and report instead of resuming a stale one.

**Push** (CLI mirror only) — the cleared map goes back to the cloud, so the other machine cannot
resume the same handoff a second time:

```bash
proton-drive filesystem upload -f create-new-revision -t "$HANDOFFS_DIR/handoff_map.json" /my-files/Documents/Handoffs
```

Complete when the transfer summary lists the map as uploaded.

### 4. Proceed

Give the user a short brief: focus, current state, discrepancies from step 2, and the first next step.
Invoke the doc's suggested skills where they fit, then start the first next step. When that step is a
consequential or ambiguous call, confirm it with the user first.
